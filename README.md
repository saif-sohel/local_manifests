# Local manifests for udon

Once you have initialised repo, clone your local manifest.

Now sync up, now manually clone firmware repository and build your ROM.

> [!CAUTION]
> By building a ROM by using these trees, you agree that you are now on your own, any bricks directly or indirectly due to my trees on your or your users phones are not my fault or my liability. Neither will I help fix your build issues if you are disrespectful and DM me. Flash safely and have fun.
